# ALPIP-Dusty-Plasma

This project is a C++ simulation with a python frontend for visualization of dust super-particles and their gravitational and Magnetic field interactions using a Particle in Cell (PIC) approach.

# Dependencies

To compile and run the code the following should be installed:
The C++ code requires the [FFTW library](https://www.fftw.org/) to perform the necessary fast fourier transforms.
The python script requires matplotlib and pandas to be installed.
